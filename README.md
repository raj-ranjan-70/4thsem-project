My Meal Planner & Recipe Search Website 🍽️🛒

Excited to share my latest project – a Meal Planner and Recipe Search Web Application designed to simplify healthy eating and meal organization!
🔍 Key Features:
 ✅ Plan your meals for the week with a clean, user-friendly interface
 ✅ Search for recipes based on available ingredients
 ✅ Auto-generate your grocery list based on your meal plan
 ✅ Responsive design for both desktop and mobile users
 ✅ User authentication with personalized dashboards
 ✅ 'About Us' page to showcase the mission and goals of the platform
Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, this project is perfect for anyone looking to stay on top of their nutrition and organization game.

This was a great learning experience combining frontend and backend development, UI/UX design, and real-world problem-solving.

Would love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or suggestions! 🙌
